## About Torii GraphQL Models

Torii exposes dynamically generated models based on your world's models. We can use this to generate a GraphQL SDK for easy querying of the world.

You can access the GraphQL dashboard by navigating to [https://api.cartridge.gg/x/pistols/torii/graphql](https://api.cartridge.gg/x/pistols/torii/graphql) or [http://0.0.0.0:8080/graphql](http://0.0.0.0:8080/graphql) if your Torii is running locally.


## Development Setup

It is recommended that each developer create their own bot on Discord for testing.

Give it wour name so we can identify each one, like: `pistols-bot-joe`

Contact us to get the test server invite and roles.
